# Task 3: Design a map

First we'll load the data. The `sf` function `st_read` understands what format the file is so it needs no further specification.

```{r load_data}
hw1 <- st_read("data/HW1/HW1.gpkg", layer = "CountryWatch")
```
It's a good idea to check if the data is projected, which it is not. `TRUE` here means that it is in long/lat form, which is not projected.
```{r inspect_data}
st_is_longlat(hw1)
```
