# Vector approach

The R package for working with vector data is `sf`. Functions associated with this package typically start with st_.

We're given three data files for this assignment: `basemaps.gpkg`, `inputs.gpkg`, and `Wind2002_which_one`. GeoPackage files can contain multiple layers so first I'll check what's in basemaps:

```{r basemaps_layers}
st_layers("HW3/data_hw3/basemaps.gpkg")$name
```

We won't need these for the analysis so I won't load them at this point.

Let's see what's in `inputs.gpkg`:

```{r}
st_layers("HW3/data_hw3/basemaps.gpkg")$name
```
